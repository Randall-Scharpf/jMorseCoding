__Checklist__ (Don't worry if you can't satisfy all of these, but try to satisfy _almost_ all of them. Also, delete this parenthetical before posing your issue: it'll clutter up your nice neat work.)

 - [ ] I included an `@version` tag for each class and method.
 - [ ] I included an `@since` tag for each class, method, and field.
 - [ ] I tagged each method parameter and return value and gave each a brief, noun description.
