__Checklist__ (Don't worry if you can't satisfy all of these, but try to satisfy _almost_ all of them. Also, delete this parenthetical before posing your issue: it'll clutter up your nice neat work.)
 - [ ] I have listed which classes, methods, and fields have been added.
 - [ ] I have included enough test cases to show that my code does not fail in any cases.
 - [ ] I documented my work. I have mentioned anything that I have not yet documented.
   - [ ] I listed each method, field, or class that I have documented.
   - [ ] I included a brief, grammatically appropriate description for each item I documented.
   - [ ] I included details about the behavior of each method, class, or field I documented, including edge cases.
   - [ ] I included an `@version` tag for each class and method.
   - [ ] I included an `@since` tag for each class, method, and field.
   - [ ] I tagged each method parameter and return value and gave each a brief, noun description.
   - [ ] I mentioned the complexity of classes and methods where it's an important feature.
 - [ ] I have given descriptive names that match the rest of the code base to my additions.
 - [ ] I have noted which paradigms are used in my code, and they match the ones used throughout the rest of the code.
